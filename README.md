# odin-recipes
This website is to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. It will be building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The purpose of the project is to build my HTML chops, not to make it look good.

In the future, I will revisit the project to style it up with CSS.
